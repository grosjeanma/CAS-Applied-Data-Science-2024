## 📂 Folder Structure

### Theory & Practice Files
All files beginning with **"M1"** contain the theory and practical exercises for Module 1. Each day is organized as follows:

- **D1**: Day 1 - Introduction to Data Management
  - `M1-D1-DM.ipynb`: Core exercises on data management
  - `M1-D1-DM-Sol.ipynb`: Solutions for Day 1 exercises

- **D2**: Day 2 - Database Management and Data Visualization
  - `M1-D2-DB/`: Directory containing Day 2 database exercises
  - `M1-D2-DV.ipynb`: Data visualization exercises
  - `M1-D2-DV-Sol.ipynb`: Solutions for data visualization exercises

- **D3**: Day 3 - Web Scraping and APIs
  - `M1-D3-1-Web-Scraping.ipynb`: Exercises for scraping web data
  - `M1-D3-2-APIs.ipynb`: Exercises for working with APIs
  - `M1-D3-MySQL-Ex.ipynb`: Practice with MySQL databases

### Homegate Scraper
The `homegate_scraper/` folder contains all the code required to scrape data from the **Homegate.ch** website. This scraper collects comprehensive rental listings across Switzerland, which is later used for analysis in the Module 1 project.

### Report 1 - Data Science Project
The `Report1/` directory contains the **Data Science Project** for Module 1, which leverages the Homegate scraper to compile and analyze rental data from across Switzerland. The project includes:
- Full scraping implementation
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to extract insights from the rental market
